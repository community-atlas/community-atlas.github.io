        <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Community Atlas toolkit provides a simple set of tools for creating online "atlases". </p>
<p>
  The toolkit is comprised of a set of key components:
<ul>
  <li>A data standard (CommaGeoJSON)</li>
  <li>A reference browser implementation (CommaBrowser)</li>
  <li>A demo atlas editor (Implemented using Coda.io)</li>
</ul>

        <h2>Project Architecture</h2>
        <p><strong>
            The Community Atlas is constructed with a few, loosely connected parts. Rather than building one tool to
            create, view and store atlases, we have split the project into separate elements that communicate through an
            open data standard. This “decoupled” architecture allows each aspect to be developed independently, and
            maximises the possible longevity and reusability of the technical work.
          </strong></p>
      </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col s12">
        <h3>The Community Mapping Geo Data standard (CommaGeoJSON)</h3>
        <i class="fas fa-vector-square left"></i>
        <p>The foundation of the atlas platform is a way of storing and sharing geodata. This standard is based on
          geoJSON,
          the primary open standard for sharing geo information, but extends this base to include a set of features that
          better suit the
          requirements of smaller groups looking to share information about their neighbourhoods and communities. </p>
        <p>CommaGeoJSON Standard definition: <a
            href="https://community-atlas.github.io/commaGeoJson-spec/">https://community-atlas.github.io/commaGeoJson-spec/</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          By building on the geoJSON standard, almost all online mapping tools are able to load and present our atlases,
          ensuring the greatest possible interoperability. The open standard will also enable the possibility of wide
          collaboration by allowing anyone to build new tools, to create or view atlases independently.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col s12">
        <h3>The Atlas Browser</h3>
        <i class="fas fa-window-maximize left"></i>
        <p>The tool for exploring community atlases is the third project component. This light-weight application runs
          entirely in the browser, and will be able to display any atlas that
          provides data in our format.
        </p>
        <p>
          The browser allows for information to be visualised as maps, timelines or cards, with data filterable in
          various ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          The source code for the browser is available at : <a
            href="https://github.com/community-atlas/commaBrowser">https://github.com/community-atlas/commaBrowser</a>

        <h3>Data storage</h3>
        <i class="fas fa-database left"></i>
        <p>
          There is no database for the atlases and all data is contained in the data file.
        </p>

        <p>The atlas data files currently hosted as part of the Comensi project, but the locations can be updated in
          configuration. </p>

        <h3>The Atlas Creator</h3>
        <i class="fas fa-edit left"></i>
        <p>The second component of work is an atlas creator, designed as an initial version to meet the needs of the
          Comensi project to collect and publish atlases.
          This tool has been built for use by a small number of engaged teams, and as such has been created to enable
          maximum customizability. </p>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Atlas creator has been built using an online platform called coda.io. Coda allows us to create rapidly
          customisable tools for data entry. It has limitations in the kind of aspects that can be changed, but these
          can easily be overcome by simple training and documentation.
        </p>
        <p><a href="https://coda.io/@greenman/playground-atlas">The atlas creator for Comensi's Playground Test
            Atlas</a></p>
        <p>
          Data is extracted from Coda using a small back-end system built on an open source tool called Node-Red.
